## What a party pooper, how could you ruin the fun for everyone else?
Well I'm tired of seeing everyone spam my social media feed with Wordle, and I also want to practice some reverse engineering. Javascript is also a new language for me (yes, what a shocker), so it's good for me to get some practice as well. 


## List of cracked sites: 
- Wordle (the original), https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk
- Katapat (Bahasa Malayu), https://www.projecteugene.com/katapat.html
- Word-leh! (Singlish version), https://word-leh.tiiny.site/ 

## Sites in progress: (you're next!)
- ChengYu (https://cheeaun.github.io/chengyu-wordle, https://github.com/cheeaun/chengyu-wordle)
Stuck here mainly because I'm too lazy to process the list Chinese words
